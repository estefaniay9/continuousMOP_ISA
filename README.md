COCO functions adjusted to read directly into PlatEMO
  - Functions are still lacking a PF. Will read in when obtained.
Adjusted Global.m that is used to include the COCO dimensions in the filename.
Automate PlatEMO run for chosen problems and algorithms. COCO problems runs in a separate file.
Automate reading in above chosen problems and algorithms and calculating metrics.
Data outputs obtained so far.
