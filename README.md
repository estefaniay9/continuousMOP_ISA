# Continuous Multi-Objective Optimisation Benchmark Analysis

This project is an extension to PlatEMO which feed as inputs into Instance Space Analysis. The aim is to automate code to run through the test problems and algorithms to obtain performance metrics across all problems and evaluate.

*Pre-requisites*

PlatEMO v2.2.1: https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO.git

bbobela: https://github.com/andremun/bbobela.git

MATSuMoTo: https://github.com/Piiloblondie/MATSuMoTo.git (Only if creating new instances using DACE method. This is how the new_DTLZ and new_WFG problems were generated.)

InstanceSpace: https://github.com/andremun/InstanceSpace
